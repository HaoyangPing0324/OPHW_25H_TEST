You may use the PAP_CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .fdc file to demote this message to a WARNING.
You can find the related information of the nets {clk nt_clk} to set the attribute.
These following examples can be referenced in the .fdc file to override this clock rule, or you can find the actual object in the UCE GUI.
